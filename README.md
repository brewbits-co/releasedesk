## About the Project

**ReleaseDesk** is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to App Stores / AppCenter / TestFlight / etc.

It helps you manage app releases, write meaningful release notes, and publish them across multiple channels (**beta**, **stable**, or custom ones).

With **ReleaseDesk**, you can:

- **Distribute your apps** both internally and externally through a customizable **Download Portal**
- **Control access** using **distribution groups**
- **Automate your CI/CD pipeline** with release workflows that:
    - Trigger announcements (email notifications, webhooks, etc.)
    - Integrate with your app for **in-app updates**
    - Generate update feeds in formats like **JSON**, **XML**, **Squirrel**, **Sparkle**, and more
